### Testing my Readme document.
## This is my first readme document and my first testing as well. We have ten pin bowling game for testing where game has ten frames, in each game bowler has two chances to knock down many pins with the bowling. Test has be done in different features, testing all ones, testing for a one spare test case, testing for one strike, testing for perfect game, testing for all spares, testing for last frame point and  testing for all zeros.
## As codes had been provided, I fixed the codes and tested all the cases and only at last I push it into Git. So, not many Git push are done but done some.
## While fixing codes, I have called the function and then found lots of errors while running it, then I have followed all the error message from the terminal and tried to fixed them and at last all the errors were fixed. I did took some pictures while doing this as well and some pictures are listed below.
I have done some debugging as well, just marked one point at top and second point in the bottom and did run and debug then it showed the errors in lines.
## While commiting made a first commit as initil commit then software project with errors and then final codes, changes and refactoring, and Readme file at the last.
## At the end of the testing I have done the refactoring to make the codes more shorter and formated.
## Done Git push after I finished everything with the testing.
